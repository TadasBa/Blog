      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Tadas, a software developer with a passion for computer science and technology. <br></br> <br></br>

        Back in 2017, when I was in 9th grade, I decided to explore the field of informatics and enrolled
        in my first programming course. It completely changed my perspective — computer science turned out to
        be far more fascinating and different from anything I had experienced or imagined before. 
        As the course ended, I realized there was so much more to learn, which fueled my curiosity, 
        and I began diving deeper into one topic after another.<br></br> <br></br>

        Fast forward to today, I’ve worked with programming languages such as C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Python, 
        explored different programming paradigms, and learned to use various technologies. 
        I've also applied this knowledge to numerous web, desktop, and mobile projects along the way. <br></br> <br></br>

        These days I am mainly focusing on my Software Engineering studies in Vilnius University.

      <h2>About This Blog</h2>
      <p>
        I started this blog to capture and share what I’ve learned, both in tech and life in general. 
        It’s a space where I will be trying to express my ideas, talk about the things I’m exploring, 
        and hopefully connect with others who are on similar paths.<br></br> <br></br>

        I aim to write about the technical aspects I work on, offering tutorials and insights, 
        while also touching on personal experiences and thoughts that might resonate beyond the screen. <br></br> <br></br>

        If you find something useful or interesting here, I truly appreciate it. <br></br> <br></br>
