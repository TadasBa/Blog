          <p>
            Hi, I'm Tadas, a software developer with a passion for computer science and technology. <br /><br />
            Back in 2017, when I was in 9th grade, I decided to explore the field of informatics and enrolled
            in my first programming course. It completely changed my perspective — computer science turned out to
            be far more fascinating than anything I had experienced before.
            As the course ended, I realized there was so much more to learn, which fueled my curiosity, 
            and I began diving deeper into one topic after another.<br /><br />
            Fast forward to today, I’ve worked with programming languages such as C/C++, C#, JavaScript, Python, 
            explored different programming paradigms, and learned to use various technologies.
            I've also applied this knowledge to numerous web, desktop, and mobile projects along the way. <br /><br />
            These days I am mainly focusing on my Software Engineering studies in Vilnius University.

      <h1>About This Blog</h1>
          <p>
            I started this blog to capture and share what I’ve learned, both in tech and life in general. 
            It’s a space where I will be trying to express my ideas, talk about the things I’m exploring, 
            and hopefully connect with others who are on similar paths.<br /><br />
            I aim to write about the technical aspects I work on, offering tutorials and insights, 
            while also touching on personal experiences and thoughts that might resonate beyond the screen. <br /><br />
            If you find something useful or interesting here, I truly appreciate it. <br /><br />
